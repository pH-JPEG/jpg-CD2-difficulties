# jpg-CD2-difficulties
 Difficulties I have created for the game Deep Rock Galactic with the Custom Difficulty 2 (CD2) mod. CD2 is in public beta and not completed yet.

## [Main Difficulties](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-CD2-difficulties/tree/main/Main%20Difficulties)
These are the "high-effort" difficulties I've created, intended to be another way to enjoy a (mostly) 6x2-esque experience in modded DRG. The list will consist of CD1 difficulties ported over to CD2 and entirely new difficulties I have created with CD2. The list is chronological with newer difficulties by date of porting or creation will be on the bottom.

The main difficulties so far are:
- [ND](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-CD2-difficulties/blob/main/Main%20Difficulties/ND/ND.json)
  - **REQUIRES THE MORE ENEMY VARIANTS MOD BY YINNY.** This mod can be found in the [Practical DRG Discord](https://discord.gg/hFkqMXPBzA) under the modding-forum channel as its own post labeled "WIP More Enemy Variants (MEV)." Without the mod, a host cannot load the difficulty file in Custom Difficulty while some enemies are invisible to a client who joined a ND lobby without downloading MEV.
  - Originally from CD1. The more balanced, consistent, and polished successor to Lx2 and Lx2EX which serves as an initial experiment with MEV. Features are listed [here](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-CD2-difficulties/blob/main/Main%20Difficulties/ND/ND%20Features.txt).
  - *Latest update:* Updated for Season 5; StationaryEnemyCount, StationaryEnemyDiversity 6->8. DisruptiveEnemyPoolCount 9->10.
  - [NB](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-CD2-difficulties/blob/main/Main%20Difficulties/ND/NB.json): A faster paced version of ND that only changes EnemyNormalWaveInterval and EnemyWaveInterval. Intended to give a light, Send It flavor to ND.
- [Lx2EX](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-CD2-difficulties/blob/main/Main%20Difficulties/Lx2EX/Lx2EX.json)
  - **REQUIRES THE MORE ENEMY VARIANTS MOD BY YINNY.** This mod can be found in the [Practical DRG Discord](https://discord.gg/hFkqMXPBzA) under the modding-forum channel as its own post labeled "WIP More Enemy Variants (MEV)." Without the mod, a host cannot load the difficulty file in Custom Difficulty while some enemies are invisible to a client who joined a Lx2EX lobby without downloading MEV.
  - Originally from CD1. For when the cave madness from Lx2 wasn't enough. Significantly RNG-based. Features are listed [here](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-CD2-difficulties/blob/main/Main%20Difficulties/Lx2EX/Lx2EX%20Features.txt).
  - *Latest update:* Updated for Season 5; StationaryEnemyCount, StationaryEnemyDiversity 6->8. DisruptiveEnemyPoolCount 9->10.
  - [Lx2EX ECCOM'D](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-CD2-difficulties/blob/main/Main%20Difficulties/Lx2EX/Lx2EX%20ECCOM'D.json): Lx2EX modified to fit the tastes of the team ECCOM OPERATIONAL. Nerfs some features and removes some RNG but adds some new Stationary enemies.
- Send It!
  - Originally from CD1. A version of 6x2 with no swarms, but frequent waves. Description is listed [here](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-CD2-difficulties/blob/main/Main%20Difficulties/Send%20It!/Send%20It!%20Features.txt).
  - *Latest update:* Updated for Season 5; StationaryEnemyCount, StationaryEnemyDiversity 4->6. DisruptiveEnemyPoolCount max 7->8. MinPoolSize 14->15.
  - [Send It! Classic](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-CD2-difficulties/blob/main/Main%20Difficulties/Send%20It!/Send%20It!%20Classic.json): Send It without any CD2 features that make it easier, equivalent to the CD1 version.
- [Lx2](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-CD2-difficulties/blob/main/Main%20Difficulties/Lx2/Lx2.json)
  - **REQUIRES THE MORE ENEMY VARIANTS MOD BY YINNY.** This mod can be found in the [Practical DRG Discord](https://discord.gg/hFkqMXPBzA) under the modding-forum channel as its own post labeled "WIP More Enemy Variants (MEV)." Without the mod, a host cannot load the difficulty file in Custom Difficulty while some enemies are invisible to a client who joined a ND lobby without downloading MEV.
