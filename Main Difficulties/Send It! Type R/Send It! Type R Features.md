Send It! Type R is a combination of the two difficulties [Send It!](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-CD2-difficulties/blob/main/Main%20Difficulties/Send%20It!/Send%20It!%20Features.txt) and [6x2EX](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-CD2-difficulties/blob/main/Main%20Difficulties/6x2EX/6x2EX%20Features.txt).

**DISCLAIMER:** Due to current CD2 limitations, Point Extraction and Escort missions are not recommended for playing. These mission types do not play correctly and are either too difficult or too trivial. All other mission types should be played instead with Mining, Egg, Salvage, and Refinery missions being the best ways to enjoy this difficulty.

# Notable Features
- No swarms.
- 90% of the time, a wave spawns every 30 seconds. 10% of the time, a wave spawns every 60 seconds. Depending on the version played, these timers can change.
- Hazard 7 bug movement speed is used.
- Reduced stationary and encounter spawns to encourage pushing.

# Difficulty Variants
The difficulty has two versions, FL5 and EK9.
- **[FL5]()**
  - FL5 is the main, recommended version of Send It! Type R. It has a safety net to prevent snowballing; the more dwarves that are currently down, the longer the wave timer with a 90% chance of occurring becomes. If 1 dwarf is down, the timer increases to 40 seconds. If 2 dwarves are down, the timer increases to 45 seconds. If 3 dwarves are down, the timer increases to 47.5 seconds.
- **[EK9]()**
  - EK9 is the harder version of Send It! Type R. It does not have the safety net that FL5 has; wave timers remain the same regardless of how many dwarves are currently downed. This can easily lead to a team snowballing into a loss. This was actually the reason why Send It! Type R ceased development in CD1; the difficulty was too unfun to keep testing as it demanded near perfect 6x2EX speedplay. If anyone went down, the game could easily spiral into a loss. However, for those interested in challenge, this version exists. It may receive other updates in the future as other changes have been made to Type R other than simply porting it from CD1 to CD2 to keep working on it.
