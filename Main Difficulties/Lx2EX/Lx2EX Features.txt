The mod More Enemy Variants (MEV) by yinny is required. If you are trying to host without MEV, Custom Difficulty will not allow you to load the file. If you join a lobby with Lx2EX and you don't have MEV yourself, there will be invisible enemies.
Compared to Lx2, Lx2EX adds/changes these features:
Bad RNG rolls for swarm/wave timers and wave sizes more common.
Start with 40 nitra and revive with 40% HP compared to 10%. Also autoregen to 40%.
Enemy caps changed to 90, 180, 240, 240 for 1p to 4p.
Respawning Breeders more common.
More Patrol Bots, Grabbers, Wardens, Shellbacks, and Septics that can spawn in a single spawn event.
Nexuses spawn white Slashers
Breeders, Swarmer Tunnels, and Eggs spawn white Exploders.
Slightly more Praetorians.
Weak Arbalest and Lacerator (about Menace HP) spawn in waves.
Younglings, Shellbacks, and Trawlers spawn in all biomes.
