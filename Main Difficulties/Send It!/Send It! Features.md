Send It! is a quicker version of 6x2. Swarms do not exist, but there are frequent small waves of bugs.

**DISCLAIMER:** Due to current CD2 limitations, Point Extraction and Escort missions are not recommended for playing. These mission types do not play correctly and are either too difficult or too trivial. All other mission types should be played instead with Mining, Egg, Salvage, and Refinery missions being the best ways to enjoy this difficulty.

# Notable Features
- No swarms.
- 90% of the time, a wave spawns every 45 seconds. 10% of the time, a wave spawns every 60 seconds. Depending on the version played, these timers can change.
- Hazard 7 bug movement speed is used.
- Reduced stationary and encounter spawns to encourage pushing.
- Reduce enemy caps to prevent too many bugs existing at once.

# Difficulty Variants
The difficulty has two versions, Standard and Classic.
- **[Standard](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-CD2-difficulties/blob/main/Main%20Difficulties/Send%20It!/Send%20It!.json)**
  - The standard version is the intended CD2 version of Send It. The only difference between this and the Classic version is that a safety net to prevent snowballing has been added. For every dwarf that is currently downed, the wave timer with a 90% chance to be rolled grows longer, allowing teams some time to recover. If 1 dwarf is down, the timer increases to 50 seconds. If 2 dwarves are down, the timer increases to 55 seconds. If 3 dwarves are down, the timer increases to 60 seconds.
- **[Classic](https://github.com/pH-JPEG/jpg-CD2-difficulties/blob/main/Main%20Difficulties/Send%20It!/Send%20It!%20Classic.json)**
  - This is the harder version of CD2 version of Send It as it's just a port of the CD1 version; this means it does not have the safety net.
