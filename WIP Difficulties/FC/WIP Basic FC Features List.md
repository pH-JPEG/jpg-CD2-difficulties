As FC is still a WIP difficulty, this feature list may be subject to change. It may not always be accurate.
**The mod More Enemy Variants (MEV) by yinny is required. If you are trying to host without MEV, Custom Difficulty will not allow you to load the file. If you join a lobby with FC and you don't have MEV yourself, there will be invisible enemies.**
**The mod DEA by donnie danko is required. Same logic from missing MEV applies.**
# General
- Enemy HP scaling follows Hazard 6.
- Enemy movement speed follows Hazard 7.
- Enemy damage scaling follows Hazard 7.
- Initial resupply cost is 40 nitra, afterwards it raises to 60 nitra.
- Enemy projectile speed follows Hazard 6 and Hazard 7.
- Friendly fire is set to 110%.
- You revive with 40% HP and regen up to 40% of your HP compared to the typical 10% seen in Hazard 5 and other modded Hazards.
- Dorretta resists 75% of damage; it is the same as the value used in 6x2.
- During the Extraction phase of a mission or the PE countdown until the Drop Pod lands, x1.66 or x2 more bugs spawn respectively.
- During the time in-between the Fuel Cells and the Drop Pod opening on a Salvage mission, there will initially be a pause in bug spawns with the amount of bugs spawning greatly increasing as the Drop Pod gets closer to opening.
- Whenever an Egg is pulled, if it does not trigger a swarm, the wave it summons spawns x4 the bugs.
- Wave timers are loosely based off of Hazard 7 with low chances for a swarm or wave to spawn instantly.
- A "fat" wave of bugs can occasionally spawn. This is a wave that is twice the size of a typical wave.
- Enemy diversity is higher and more variable; this means you can get multiple types of enemies all spawning at once with the amount being variable. You could get a superdiverse wave or a wave of only one or two enemy types.
- Most caves will have at least one of every Stationary type if possible.
- Veteran chance has been significantly increased; this means more Guards, Slashers, Brundles, Trijaws, and Oppressors.
- Many new enemies have been added in the form of enemies that normally don't spawn in waves and entirely new enemies from MEV and DEA.
- Some existing enemies have been modified.
- Custom waves of certain enemies spawn at set intervals or conditions.

# Enemies
- **Canary**

- **Sentinel**
  - These are the bugs the Dreadnought Hiveguard summon. These also move 35% faster.
- **Leech**
  - These move x2 faster. These will only move at x1.35 if a Scalebramble is on the map. However, if a Leech from high up grabs you and it's killed, you will not die of fall damage.
- **Fire Bomber**
  - This is an unused enemy in the game files. It behaves like a normal Goo Bomber, except it drops bomblets that deal extreme damage to players.
